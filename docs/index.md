# SOCless

SOCless is a serverless framework built to help security teams easily automate their incident response and operations processes.

## Overview
SOCless uses the [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/) and [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) services to execute user-defined workflows. The workflows, called Playbooks, are defined as JSON objects and triggered by real-time alerts from http-based data sources or scheduled events from [AWS CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).
