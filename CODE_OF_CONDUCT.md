# Code Of Conduct

Twilio strives to be an inclusive, tolerant, and welcoming community. We encourage participation from anyone regardless of age, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, political belief, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

> “A gentle word turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger."

Our users, contributors, and collaborators are expected to treat each other with kindness and respect, to assume good intentions, and to gently correct, where possible, rather than react with escalation. While our goal is to be as accurate as possible, kindness and understanding are more valuable than correctness. Some examples of behavior we will not tolerate include, but is not limited to:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Unwelcome advances, sexual or otherwise
* Insults or derogatory comments, or personal or political attacks
* Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

If someone is violating this Code of Conduct you may email [help@twilio.com](mailto:help@twilio.com) to bring your concern to the Members. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
